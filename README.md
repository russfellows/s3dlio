# How to Guide

## S3 Rust Library and CLI
This guide shows how to use the Rust library, which supports both a compiled command line interface executable called ```s3-cli``` and Python library, compiled into a wheel file. Using this wheel, the Python library may be installed, imported via  `import s3dlio as s3` and used by Python programs.

### Purpose
The purpose of this library is to enable testing of S3 storage via both a cli and a Python library.  The intention is to create hooks to DLIO, so that it may access S3 storage during its testing.  The six primary operations for S3 are included: 
 - get
 - put
 - list
 - stat
 - delete
 - create-bucket.

Additionally, the cli supports commands to upload and download data.  These are:
 - upload
 - download

These operations will respectively upload/put a local file as an object, or download/get an object as a local file.  

**Note** that bucket creation currently occurs only as part of a Put operation.  

### Container
For ease of testing, both the cli and library may be built into a container as well.  The Rust source code is removed from this container in order to reduce its size.  

### Plan for Publishing
In the near future, the Python library `s3dlio` will be published on PyPi for distribution.  The compiled Rust executable and Python wheel files are already published on GitHub and are availble under the release section of this project.  

# How to Build
In order to build this project, you can build the code and libraries and use them directly. 

### Prerequisites 
1. Rust, see [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install] How to Install Rust
2. The `maturin` command, which may be installed with pip, uv or some other tools
3. The `patchelf` executable, best installed with system packages, such as `sudo apt-get install patchelf` or similar 

## Building Executables and Libraries
### Rust Environment Pre-Req
Given this is a Rust project, you must install the Rust toolchain, including cargo, etc.
The following installs the Rust toolchain:
```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### Python Environment Pre-Req
A Python environment is required.  The uv package manager and virtual environment works well.  
The 'uv' tool may be installed via: 
```
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Next, you will need a virtual environment, along with Python
Here are the steps:
1. ```uv venv```
2. ```source .venv/bin/activate```
3. ```uv python install 3.12```

### Building the CLI
To build the executable cli code:
 * At the top of the project issue: `cargo build --release`
 * Upon success the executable called `s3-cli` will exist in the ./target/release directory

### Building the Python Library
This step requires the Python Environment pre-reqs listed above.
 * First, make certain you have activated your virtual environment
 * If using uv, the command `source .venv/bin/activate` will do so
 * Next, to build the python library: `maturin build --release --features extension-module`
 * Upon success a python wheel will exist in the ./target/wheels directory

## Container
A container image may be built from the source code in this repository.  Also, examining the Dockerfile may help users better understand how to build the code outside of a container by examining the steps in the Dockerfile.  
The container will contain the executable, along with a python library.  This allows you to run either the Rust cli, or a python program that uses the Python library.
### Building / Pulling
Either docker or podman may be used to create the image, typically with a `podman build -t xxx .` where xxx is the name you want to use for your container image. For those that want to simply pull and run a pre-built container, a relatively recent image may be found on quay.io.  However, the version on quay may be older than that available by building from the source code in this repository.  

***Note:** An OLD container is here:  https://quay.io/repository/russfellows-sig65/dealio_s3_rust*

In order to pull the container using docker, you may execute the following:

```
docker pull quay.io/russfellows-sig65/s3dlio
```
***Note 2:** The above container does not exist currently*

### Running Container
Here is an example of starting a container using podman, and listing the contents of the containers /app directory.  
***Note:** It is VERY important to use the "--net=host" or similar command when starting, since using S3 necessitates network connectivity to S3 storage.*

```
eval@loki-node3:~/real-dealio2$ podman run --net=host --rm -it dealio_s3-rust 
root@loki-node3:/app# ls
README.md  dlio_s3_test3.py  target  test_all_dlio_s3.py
root@loki-node3:/app# which python
/app/.venv/bin/python
root@loki-node3:/app# python --version
Python 3.12.8
```

# S3 Access
This library and CLI currently support accessing S3 via http without TLS, and S3 with TLS via https for both official, and self signed certificates.  There is NO option to connect via TLS and ignore certificate errors.  There are several reasons for this, the two biggest ones being:
1) It is VERY difficult to do this with the current Rust crates and AWS S3 SDK
2) It is VERY dangerous, and strongly discouraged

## Important S3 Environment Info
Setting up the environment variables and information necessary to access S3 can be somewhat tricky.  This code supports the use of variables read in from a ```.env``` file, OR environment variables.  Note that the examples here have sample .env files.  The values included from a private test environment, thus the ACCESS_KEY and SECRET_KEY values are not a concern.  Again, these may be set as environment variables if desired, but probably easier to set them in the .env file, which is read in by default.

***Note:** The following values are required:*
```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=some-id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=my-secret
AWS_ENDPOINT_URL=https://dns-name-or-ipaddr:port-number
AWS_REGION=region-if-needed
```
***Note:** The following value is OPTIONAL, but **REQUIRED** if using a self signed certificate with TLS access to S3:*
```
AWS_CA_BUNDLE_PATH=/a/path/to-myfile.pem
```

Here are the contents of the sample .env file:
```
eval@loki-node3:~/real-dealio2$ cat .env
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=BG0XPVXISBP41DCXOQR8
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=kGSmlMHBl0ohc/nYRtGbBx4KCfpdPN1/fLbtjUyX
AWS_ENDPOINT_URL=http://10.9.0.21
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
S3_BUCKET=my-bucket2
```

# Python
The intention of this entire library is to provide a Python library for interacting with S3.  The Rust CLI provides a way to check the underlying functions without worrying about constructing a Python program, or syntax errors.  Because it is pure Rust, it also more accurately displays the potential performance that may be attained.  However, using the Python library is the intention.  In the "docs" subdirectory, there is a quick overview of the Python API, written by a chat agent.  For those who prefer examples, there is a sample Python script to test the APIs, shown below.

## Running a Python Test
Note: The following example shows running the `test_new_dlio_s3.py` Python script, after changing the number of objects to 500, by editing the file.  The default number of objects to use for testing is only 5 objects.  In order to display more accurate performance values, the following example shows running the test with `NUM_OBJECTS = 500` setting.

```

# Using the Rust CLI
If you built this project locally, outside a container, you will have to install the executable, or provide the path to its location, which by default is in the "./target/release" directory.
If running in the container, the Rust executable is in your path.  A  ```which s3-cli``` shows its location:

```
root@loki-node3:/app# which s3-cli
/usr/local/bin/s3-cli
```

Running the command without any arguments shows the usage:

```
root@loki-node3:/app# s3-cli                           
Usage: s3-cli <COMMAND>

Commands:
  list      List keys that start with the given prefix
  get       Download one or many objects
  delete    Delete one object or every object that matches the prefix
  put       Upload one or more objects concurrently, uses ObjectType format filled with random data
  upload    Upload local files (PUT, but from disk not RAM)
  download  Download object(s) â†’ directory
  help      Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -v, --verbose...  Increase log verbosity: -v = Info, -vv = Debug
  -h, --help     Print help
  -V, --version  Print version
root@loki-node3:/app#
```

### Example --help for subcommand

First is an example of getting help for the `get` subcommand:

```
root@loki-node3:/app# s3-cli get --help 
Download one or many objects

Usage: s3-cli get [OPTIONS] <URI>

Arguments:
  <URI>  S3 URI â€“ can be a full key or a prefix ending with `/`

Options:
  -j, --jobs <JOBS>  Maximum concurrent GET requests [default: 64]
  -h, --help         Print help


```
Next is an example of help for the `put` subcommand:

```
root@loki-node3:/app# s3-cli put --help
Upload one or more objects concurrently, uses ObjectType format filled with random data

Usage: s3-cli put [OPTIONS] <URI_PREFIX>

Arguments:
  <URI_PREFIX>  S3 URI prefix (e.g. s3://bucket/prefix)

Options:
  -c, --create-bucket              Optionally create the bucket if it does not exist
  -j, --jobs <JOBS>                Maximum concurrent uploads (jobs), but is modified to be min(jobs, num) [default: 32]
  -n, --num <NUM>                  Number of objects to create and upload [default: 1]
  -o, --object-type <OBJECT_TYPE>  What kind of object to generate: [default: RAW] [possible values: NPZ, TFRECORD, HDF5, RAW]
  -s, --size <SIZE>                Object size in bytes (default 20 MB) [default: 20971520]
  -t, --template <TEMPLATE>        Template for object names. Use '{}' as a placeholder [default: object_{}_of_{}.dat]
  -h, --help                       Print help
```



### Additional CLI Examples
Here are several examples of running the ```s3-cli``` command:

```
root@loki-node3:/app# s3-cli list s3://my-bucket4/
...
/russ-test3-989.obj
/russ-test3-99.obj
/russ-test3-990.obj
/russ-test3-991.obj
/russ-test3-992.obj
/russ-test3-993.obj
/russ-test3-994.obj
/russ-test3-995.obj
/russ-test3-996.obj
/russ-test3-997.obj
/russ-test3-998.obj
/russ-test3-999.obj

Total objects: 1200
```
#### Example Delete command and List
```
root@loki-node3:/app# s3-cli delete s3://my-bucket4/
Deleting 1200 objectsâ€¦
Done.
root@loki-node3:/app# s3-cli list s3://my-bucket4/

Total objects: 0
```
#### Example put and then delete to cleanup
Note: This use of put only uses a single set of braces `{}` , and will thus each object will have only the object number, and not the total number in the name:
```
root@loki-node3:/app# s3-cli put -c -n 1200 -t russ-test3-{}.obj s3://my-bucket4/
Uploaded 1200 objects (total 25165824000 bytes) in 7.607254643s (157.74 objects/s, 3154.88 MB/s)

root@loki-node3:/app# 
root@loki-node3:/app# s3-cli get -j 32 s3://my-bucket4/
Fetching 1200 objects with 32 jobsâ€¦
