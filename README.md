High-performance, multi-protocol storage library for AI/ML workloads with universal copy operations across S3, Azure, local file systems, and DirectIO.

## 📊 Operation Logging (Op-Log) - All Backends (v0.8.12)

**NEW**: Universal operation trace logging now supports ALL storage backends (file://, s3://, az://, direct://). Performance profiling and debugging for any storage system with the same TSV format used for S3.

```python
import s3dlio

# Initialize op-log (once at start)
s3dlio.init_op_log("/tmp/operations.tsv.zst")

# All operations automatically logged
s3dlio.upload(["./data/*.dat"], "file:///backup/", max_in_flight=8, create_bucket=False)
s3dlio.download("direct:///fast-storage/", "./local/", max_in_flight=16, recursive=True)

# Finalize (once at end)
s3dlio.finalize_op_log()
```

**Features**: Zstd-compressed TSV logs, warp-replay compatible, clean file paths, zero overhead when not initialized. Works with Rust API, Python API, and CLI (`--op-log` flag).

## 📇 TFRecord Index Generation (v0.8.10)

Generate NVIDIA DALI-compatible index files for efficient random access to TFRecord datasets. Enables shuffled data loading, distributed training, and O(1) record seeking with minimal overhead (0.4% file size). Pure Rust implementation with comprehensive Python API.

```python
import s3dlio

# Generate index for efficient random access
s3dlio.create_tfrecord_index("train.tfrecord")

# Read index and access any record directly
index = s3dlio.read_tfrecord_index("train.tfrecord.idx")
offset, size = index[42]  # O(1) access, ~1200x faster than sequential scan
```

**Use Cases**: Random shuffling, distributed training sharding, batch loading, DALI pipeline integration. Compatible with NVIDIA DALI and TensorFlow tooling. See [Quick Reference](docs/TFRECORD-INDEX-QUICKREF.md) for details.

## 🗂️ Page Cache & Tracing (v0.8.8)

**Page Cache Optimization**: Intelligent Linux/Unix page cache hints via `posix_fadvise()` with automatic mode selection based on file size. Optimizes kernel read-ahead behavior for both sequential large files (≥64MB) and random small file access patterns.

**Tracing Framework**: Migrated from `log` crate to `tracing` ecosystem for enhanced observability. Compatible with dl-driver and s3-bench projects. Supports standard verbosity levels (`-v` for INFO, `-vv` for DEBUG) with preserved operation trace logging.

## 📊 Performance Monitoring (v0.8.7)

Advanced HDR histogram-based performance monitoring for AI/ML workloads, providing precise tail latency analysis (P99, P99.9, P99.99+) and comprehensive throughput tracking. Built-in presets for training, inference, and distributed scenarios with thread-safe global metrics collection.

## 🧠 AI/ML Training Enhancement (v0.8.6)

Added comprehensive LoaderOptions Realism Knobs for production AI/ML workloads, providing fine-grained control over data loading behavior, performance optimization, and training pipeline configuration with PyTorch/TensorFlow best practices.

## Storage Backend Support

### Universal Backend Architecture
s3dlio provides a unified interface for all storage operations, treating upload/download as enhanced copy commands that work across any backend:

- **🗄️ Amazon S3**: `s3://bucket/prefix/` - High-performance S3 operations with multiple backend choices
- **☁️ Azure Blob Storage**: `az://container/prefix/` - Complete Azure integration with hot/cool tier support  
- **📁 Local File System**: `file:///path/to/directory/` - High-speed local file operations
- **⚡ DirectIO**: `direct:///path/to/directory/` - Bypass OS cache for maximum I/O performance

### S3 Backend Options
s3dlio supports two S3 backend implementations. **Native AWS SDK is the default and recommended** for production use:

```bash
# Default: Native AWS SDK backend (RECOMMENDED for production)
cargo build --release
# or explicitly:
cargo build --no-default-features --features native-backends

# Experimental: Apache Arrow object_store backend (optional, for testing)
cargo build --no-default-features --features arrow-backend
```

**Why native-backends is default:**
- Proven performance in production workloads
- Optimized for high-throughput S3 operations (5+ GB/s reads, 2.5+ GB/s writes)
- Well-tested with MinIO, Vast, and AWS S3

**About arrow-backend:**
- Experimental alternative implementation
- No proven performance advantage over native backend
- Useful for comparison testing and development
- Not recommended for production use

## Quick Start

### Installation

**Rust CLI:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/russfellows/s3dlio.git
cd s3dlio
cargo build --release
```

**Python Library:**
```bash
pip install s3dlio
# or build from source:
./build_pyo3.sh && ./install_pyo3_wheel.sh

## Core Capabilities

### 🚀 Universal Copy Operations

s3dlio treats upload and download as enhanced versions of the Unix `cp` command, working across all storage backends:

**CLI Usage:**
```bash
# Upload to any backend with real-time progress
s3-cli upload /local/data/*.log s3://mybucket/logs/
s3-cli upload /local/files/* az://container/data/  
s3-cli upload /local/backup/* file:///remote-mount/backup/
s3-cli upload /local/cache/* direct:///nvme-storage/cache/

# Download from any backend  
s3-cli download s3://bucket/data/ ./local-data/
s3-cli download az://container/logs/ ./logs/
s3-cli download file:///network-storage/data/ ./data/

# Cross-backend copying workflow
s3-cli download s3://source-bucket/data/ ./temp/
s3-cli upload ./temp/* az://dest-container/data/
```

**Advanced Pattern Matching:**
```bash
# Glob patterns for file selection
s3-cli upload "/data/*.log" s3://bucket/logs/
s3-cli upload "/files/data_*.csv" az://container/data/

# Regex patterns for powerful matching  
s3-cli upload "/logs/.*\.log$" s3://bucket/logs/
s3-cli upload "/data/file_[0-9]+\.txt" direct:///storage/data/
```

### 🐍 Python Integration

**High-Performance Data Operations:**
```python
import s3dlio

# Universal upload/download across all backends
s3dlio.upload(['/local/data.csv'], 's3://bucket/data/')
s3dlio.upload(['/local/logs/*.log'], 'az://container/logs/')  
s3dlio.download('s3://bucket/data/', './local-data/')

# High-level AI/ML operations
dataset = s3dlio.create_dataset("s3://bucket/training-data/")
loader = s3dlio.create_async_loader("file:///data/", {"batch_size": 32})

# PyTorch integration
from s3dlio.torch import S3IterableDataset
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

dataset = S3IterableDataset("s3://bucket/data/", loader_opts={})
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=16)
```

**Streaming & Compression:**
```python
# High-performance streaming with compression
options = s3dlio.PyWriterOptions()
options.compression = "zstd"
options.compression_level = 3

writer = s3dlio.create_s3_writer('s3://bucket/data.zst', options)
writer.write_chunk(large_data_bytes)
stats = writer.finalize()  # Returns (bytes_written, compressed_bytes)

# Data generation with configurable modes
s3dlio.put("s3://bucket/test-data-{}.bin", num=1000, size=4194304, 
          data_gen_mode="streaming")  # 2.6-3.5x faster for most cases
```
