## Version 0.4.5 - Rust only - Azure Phase1

Added new bindings and backend to support Azure blob storage. As of this initial phase1 release, there are only minimal interfaces to Azure blob. Until this becomes fully flushed out, will remain as Rust only changes.

### New Tests
- azure_blob_multi.rs
- azure_blob_sequence.rs
- azure_blob_smoke.rs

---

## Version 0.4.4 - Multi-Part Upload with Zero-Copy

Added a multi-part uploader with zero buffer copies between Python and Rust. This works by providing a function that Rust executes and allocates the space for. Python can then fill the memory region and give it back to Rust. This all occurs zero-copy with Rust managing lifetimes. The memory region can be streamed to the S3 back-end, including using multi-part upload.

### New Tests
- python/tests/multi-part_smoke.py
- python/tests/test_multipart_writer.py
- tests/test_multipart.rs

### New Documentation
- MultiPart_README.md - Complete guide to multi-part features

## Version 0.4.3 - Full PyTorch DataLoader Compatibility

After many promises of a fully functional and compatible PyTorch data loader, version 0.4.3 provides functional compatibility with the aws s3torchconnector library. Also updated the Dockerfile to enable building containers again.

### New Tests
- python/tests/aws-s3dlio_compare_suite.py
- python/tests/compare_aws_s3dlio_loaders.py
- python/tests/jax_tf_vers_4-3_demo.py
- python/tests/torch_vers_4-3_demo.py

### New Documentation
- DataLoader_README.md - Complete guide to data loader features

## Version 0.4.2 - Regular Expression and Recursive Operations

Added regular expression parsing to most commands including list, delete, get and download. Added new recursive options "-r" or "--recursive" that makes operations work recursively. If the target command ends with a trailing slash "/" character, internally append a regex wildcard ".*". Also added "create-bucket" and "delete-bucket" operators as standalone commands.

---

## Version 0.4.1 - Python Data Loader Bindings

Added several python bindings to the "data-loader" interface, for use within PyTorch, TensorFlow and Jax AI/ML workflows. This feature is deemed fully functional via the Python library interfaces. Basic data-loader tests via python are available in python/tests including tf_smoke.py, jax_smoke.py and pytorch_smoke.py.

---

## Version 0.4.0 - High-Level Data Loader Interface

Added a high-level "data-loader" interface to enable use within AI/ML workflows. The data loader provides basic functionality primarily through the Python library interface where it is expected to receive most use.

---

## Version 0.3.x - I/O Tracing and Async Improvements

Added new I/O tracing capabilities using the same file format as the MinIO warp tool, enabling capture in a semi-standard way. With an I/O trace file, this enables recording and playback of S3 I/O operations. Also improved and updated the Rust-Python binding async I/O library for higher multi-threading with lower overhead and increased compatibility.

---

## Version 0.3.0 - Enhanced Data Generation and AI/ML Objects

Since the prior project "dlio_s3_rust" was archived and all future work moved to this project, several enhancements were added:
- Enhanced data generation with settable dedupe and compression ratios
- Two new cli commands: upload and download
- New "stat" command for both CLI and Python library
- AI/ML object creation options supporting 4 specific data/object types: TensorRecord, HDF5, NPZ, and Raw

## What's new in v0.3.3 branch: feature/data-loader (Stage 1 ‚Äì Core DataLoader)# What‚Äôs new in v0.3.3 branch: feature/data-loader (Stage 1 ‚Äì Core DataLoader)

In this first incremental release of our high-level data-loading API, we‚Äôve added:

### 1. Core abstractions (`src/data_loader/`)

- **`Dataset` trait** (`dataset.rs`)  
  - `len() -> Option<usize>`, `get(index)`, and `as_stream()`  
  - Supports both map-style (random access) and iterable datasets  
- **`LoaderOptions`** (`options.rs`)  
  - Two tuning knobs: `batch_size` and `drop_last`  
- **`DataLoader`** (`dataloader.rs`)  
  - `.stream()` returns an `async_stream` of `Vec<Item>` batches  
  - Automatically handles:
    - Map-style datasets with known/unknown length  
    - Iterable-only streams  
    - Final incomplete batch drop if requested  

### 2. Crate-root exports (`src/lib.rs`)

- Publicly re-exported:
  - `Dataset`, `DatasetError`, `DynStream`
  - `LoaderOptions`
  - `DataLoader`

### 3. Baseline tests (`tests/test_dataloader.rs`)

- Map-style dataset batching  
- Drop-last semantics  
- Iterable-only datasets  
- Unknown-length datasets  
- Empty datasets  

### 4. Divergences / next steps

| Planned in Stage 1                                                | Status                                                |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| First-class `Dataset` impls for RAW, NPZ, HDF5, TFRecord         | **Pending** (will add in Stage 2)                     |
| Python `pyo3` wrappers (`dataset.py` / `dataloader.py`)          | **Pending** (next release)                            |
| Smoke tests against a live MinIO bucket                          | Replaced by in-memory unit tests for fast iteration   |

Everything else in our Stage 1 blueprint is here and passing CI‚Äîso you now have a minimal, idiomatic Rust API for batching S3-backed data, ready to build on in Stage 2 (shuffling, parallel fetch, auto-tuning).
