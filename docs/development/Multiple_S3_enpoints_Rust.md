# How To Add Support for Multiple S3 Endpoints
Alright, tackling multiple S3 endpoints for improved performance in your Rust library sounds like a great next step! This can definitely lead to faster data transfers by leveraging concurrent connections to different storage locations.

Here's an overview of how we can approach this, keeping in mind your use of aws-sdk-s3 and the need to support both your CLI and Python bindings:

The core idea is to manage multiple aws_sdk_s3::Client instances, each configured for a different S3 endpoint. Then, based on your needs (e.g., the specific bucket or key, or simply to distribute load), you can choose which client to use for a particular S3 operation. For performance improvement, we'll likely want to perform operations concurrently across these clients where it makes sense (like uploading or downloading multiple objects).

Here's a breakdown of the steps involved:

Configuration for Multiple Endpoints: You'll need a way to configure and store the different S3 endpoint URLs and their corresponding configurations (like region, credentials if they differ).
Client Management: We'll create and manage multiple aws_sdk_s3::Client instances, one for each configured endpoint.
Operation Distribution: You'll need logic to decide which client to use for a given S3 operation. This could be based on factors like:
A specific endpoint associated with a bucket or a set of keys.
A round-robin approach to distribute load.
More sophisticated load balancing strategies.
Concurrent Operations: For operations that involve multiple independent tasks (like uploading or downloading several files), you can use asynchronous tasks (tokio::spawn) to perform these operations concurrently across different clients.
Integration with CLI and Python Bindings: The changes should be transparent to both your CLI and Python bindings. The library will handle the multi-endpoint logic internally.
# Supporting Multiple S3 Endpoints in Your Rust Library

This document outlines the steps to modify your Rust library to support using multiple S3 endpoints concurrently, aiming to improve performance for operations involving your local S3 storage.

## Overview of the Solution

The core idea is to manage multiple `aws_sdk_s3::Client` instances, each configured for a different S3 endpoint. Based on your needs, you can then choose which client to use for a particular S3 operation, potentially performing operations concurrently across these clients.

The development steps include:

1.  **Configuration for Multiple Endpoints:** Defining structures to hold the configuration for each S3 endpoint.
2.  **Client Management:** Creating and managing multiple `aws_sdk_s3::Client` instances.
3.  **Operation Distribution:** Implementing logic to decide which client to use for a given S3 operation.
4.  **Concurrent Operations:** Using asynchronous tasks to perform independent operations concurrently across different clients.
5.  **Integration with CLI and Python Bindings:** Ensuring the changes are transparent to both your CLI and Python bindings.

## Development Steps and Code Examples

Here are the code examples illustrating the steps discussed:

### 1. Configuration for Multiple Endpoints

```rust
use aws_config::SdkConfig;
use aws_sdk_s3::config::Builder;
use aws_sdk_s3::Client;
use std::collections::HashMap;

#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct S3EndpointConfig {
    pub url: String,
    pub region: Option<String>, // Optional, as some local S3 might not require a region
    // You might add other configuration options here, like credentials if needed
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct MultiS3Config {
    pub endpoints: HashMap<String, S3EndpointConfig>, // Key could be a name or identifier for the endpoint
}

impl MultiS3Config {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        MultiS3Config {
            endpoints: HashMap::new(),
        }
    }

    pub fn add_endpoint(&mut self, name: String, config: S3EndpointConfig) {
        self.endpoints.insert(name, config);
    }
}

pub async fn create_client_with_endpoint(config: &S3EndpointConfig) -> Result<Client, aws_sdk_s3::Error> {
    let sdk_config = SdkConfig::builder()
        .endpoint_url(config.url.clone())
        .region(config.region.clone().unwrap_or_else(|| "us-east-1".to_string()).parse().unwrap()) // Default region if not provided
        .build();

    Ok(Client::new(&sdk_config))
}

pub async fn create_multi_s3_client(config: MultiS3Config) -> Result<HashMap<String, Client>, aws_sdk_s3::Error> {
    let mut clients = HashMap::new();
    for (name, endpoint_config) in config.endpoints.iter() {
        let client = create_client_with_endpoint(endpoint_config).await?;
        clients.insert(name.clone(), client);
    }
    Ok(clients)
}
```

### 2. Client Management and Operation Distribution

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;

#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct MultiS3Client {
    clients: Arc<HashMap<String, Client>>,
    // You might add logic here to map buckets or keys to specific clients
}

impl MultiS3Client {
    pub fn new(clients: HashMap<String, Client>) -> Self {
        MultiS3Client {
            clients: Arc::new(clients),
        }
    }

    pub fn get_client_for_bucket(&self, bucket: &str) -> Option<&Client> {
        // Replace this with your actual logic to map buckets to client names
        // For example, you might have a configuration file or environment variables
        // that define these mappings.
        if bucket.starts_with("local-s3-1-") {
            self.clients.get("local_s3_1")
        } else if bucket.starts_with("local-s3-2-") {
            self.clients.get("local_s3_2")
        } else {
            // Default client if no specific mapping
            self.clients.values().next() // Or some other default logic
        }
    }

    pub async fn upload_object(
        &self,
        bucket: &str,
        key: &str,
        body: &[u8],
    ) -> Result<(), aws_sdk_s3::Error> {
        if let Some(client) = self.get_client_for_bucket(bucket) {
            client
                .put_object()
                .bucket(bucket)
                .key(key)
                .body(body.into())
                .send()
                .await?;
            Ok(())
        } else {
            Err(aws_sdk_s3::Error::Unhandled(
                "No S3 client configured for this bucket".into(),
            ))
        }
    }

    // Implement other S3 operations similarly, using the appropriate client
}
```

### 3. Concurrent Operations

```rust
use futures::future::join_all;

impl MultiS3Client {
    pub async fn upload_multiple_objects(
        &self,
        uploads: Vec<(String, String, Vec<u8>)>, // (bucket, key, body)
    ) -> Vec<Result<(), aws_sdk_s3::Error>> {
        let mut futures = Vec::new();
        for (bucket, key, body) in uploads {
            if let Some(client) = self.get_client_for_bucket(&bucket) {
                let client_clone = client.clone();
                futures.push(tokio::spawn(async move {
                    client_clone
                        .put_object()
                        .bucket(bucket)
                        .key(key)
                        .body(body.into())
                        .send()
                        .await
                        .map(|_| ())
                }));
            } else {
                futures.push(tokio::spawn(async move {
                    Err(aws_sdk_s3::Error::Unhandled(
                        format!("No S3 client configured for bucket: {}", bucket).into(),
                    ))
                }));
            }
        }
        join_all(futures).await.into_iter().map(|r| r.unwrap()).collect()
    }

    // Implement similar concurrent logic for download and other operations
}
```

### 4. Integration with CLI and Python Bindings

The `MultiS3Client` and its methods will be the core of your library. Your CLI and Python bindings will then use this `MultiS3Client` to interact with S3. The internal logic of handling multiple endpoints will be abstracted away.

* **CLI:** Your CLI commands will call functions in your library that use the `MultiS3Client`. You'll need to configure the `MultiS3Config` during CLI startup.
* **Python Bindings:** Your Python bindings (via PyO3) will expose the functions of your Rust library that utilize the `MultiS3Client`.

## Important Considerations and Next Steps

* **Endpoint Configuration:** Implement a robust way to configure the multiple S3 endpoints (e.g., configuration file, environment variables).
* **Endpoint Selection Strategy:** Design a strategy for selecting the appropriate endpoint based on your performance goals (e.g., bucket mapping, round-robin).
* **Error Handling:** Ensure proper error handling when working with multiple clients.
* **Testing:** Thoroughly test your library with multiple configured endpoints.

## Checking Library Versions

Based on your `Cargo.toml`, the library versions you are using should be compatible with the approach outlined. Ensure to consult the documentation of each crate for the specific APIs and features available in your versions.
