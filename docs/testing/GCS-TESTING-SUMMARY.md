# GCS Backend Testing Summary

## Test Results - ALL PASSED ‚úÖ

### ‚úÖ WORKING Features

1. **Upload (PUT)** - Successfully uploads files to GCS
   - Command: `s3-cli upload <file> gs://bucket/prefix/`
   - Uses Application Default Credentials (ADC)
   - Supports single and multiple files
   - Test: `test-gcs-final.sh` ‚úÖ
   
2. **List** - Successfully lists objects in GCS buckets
   - Command: `s3-cli ls gs://bucket/prefix/`
   - Returns correct object URIs (fixed duplicate prefix bug)
   - Supports recursive and non-recursive listing
   - Test: `test-gcs-final.sh` ‚úÖ
   
3. **Download (GET)** - Successfully downloads files from GCS
   - Command: `s3-cli download gs://bucket/object <dest>`
   - Retrieves correct content
   - Creates appropriate directory structure
   - Test: `test-gcs-final.sh` ‚úÖ

4. **Delete** - Successfully deletes objects from GCS
   - Command: `s3-cli delete gs://bucket/object`
   - Supports single object deletion
   - Supports prefix deletion with `-r` or trailing `/`
   - Test: `test-gcs-final.sh` ‚úÖ

5. **Authentication** - Working with Application Default Credentials
   - Uses `gcloud auth application-default login`
   - Credentials stored at `~/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json`
   - Lazy client initialization for efficiency

### üîß Implementation Details

**Bugs Fixed:**
1. `src/gcs_client.rs:273` - Changed `list_objects` to return just object names instead of full URIs
   - This prevented duplicate URI prefixes in list output (was showing `gs://bucket/gs://bucket/object`)

2. `src/bin/cli.rs:delete_cmd` - Updated to use generic ObjectStore interface
   - Now supports all URI schemes (gs://, s3://, az://, file://, direct://)
   - Made function async to work within existing async context

**Test Commands:**
```bash
# Upload
./target/release/s3-cli -v upload test.txt gs://signal65-russ-b1/

# List
./target/release/s3-cli -v ls gs://signal65-russ-b1/

# Download
./target/release/s3-cli -v download gs://signal65-russ-b1/test.txt ./output/

# Delete
./target/release/s3-cli -v delete gs://signal65-russ-b1/test.txt
```

### üìä Test Files

- **S3-compatible test**: `gcs-test.sh` (‚úÖ PASSED)
- **Native GCS gcloud test**: `test-gcloud-native.sh` (‚úÖ PASSED)
- **Native GCS s3-cli test**: `test-s3cli-gcs.sh` (‚úÖ PASSED)
- **Final comprehensive test**: `test-gcs-final.sh` (‚úÖ PASSED - all operations)

### ‚è≥ Not Yet Implemented

1. **List buckets** - GCS doesn't expose bucket listing through current SDK
   - Use `gcloud storage buckets list` as workaround
2. **Range reads via CLI** - Not exposed in CLI interface (API supports it)
3. **Python API** - Not tested yet (Rust implementation complete)
4. **Performance benchmarks** - Not run yet

### üéØ Conclusion

**The GCS backend is FULLY FUNCTIONAL!** ‚úÖ

All core operations (upload, download, list, delete) are working correctly with:
- Native `gs://` URI support
- Application Default Credentials authentication
- Proper integration with the ObjectStore trait
- Multi-backend delete command (works with gs://, s3://, az://, file://, direct://)
- Zero compilation warnings

The implementation is ready for:
1. ‚úÖ Production use for basic operations
2. ‚è≥ Python API testing
3. ‚è≥ Performance benchmarking
4. ‚è≥ Version bump and documentation update
