// src/api/advanced.rs
//! # Advanced S3DL-IO API
//!
//! This module provides advanced functionality for power users who need
//! fine-grained control over performance and behavior.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! - **Async Pool DataLoader**: High-concurrency async data loading
//! - **Direct I/O**: Zero-copy operations for maximum performance
//! - **Multipart Operations**: Advanced upload management
//! - **Custom Samplers**: Control data ordering and sampling
//!
//! ## Performance Considerations
//!
//! The advanced API provides more control but requires deeper understanding
//! of the underlying systems. Use the basic API unless you have specific
//! performance requirements.
